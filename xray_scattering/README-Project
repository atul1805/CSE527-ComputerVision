Matlab Scripts:
    1. Run LoadData.m -> The script saves a mat file called 'data.mat' of size 13x1. Each cell has data for the
                         corresponding experiment. Images are of size 128x128 and each image has multiple labels
                         associated with it.
                         data.mat -> images 
                                            13 cells of image data
                                            each cell -> (imageCountx3) cells
                                            each of these cells -> image name, image data(128x128), tags
                                     tags
                                            size -> 98x2
                                            each cell -> tag number, tag name
    
    2. BinaryCRBM     -> Extracts features from 'data.mat'. It uses these features to train and predict using SVM's.
                         It employs 13 fold cross validation and trains 98 SVM models per test set. It saves the
                         results as 'finalResult128.mat'.

    3. result.m       -> It calculates the confusion matrix, precision and recall for each tag acroos all test runs.
                         Results can be viewed in stats variable.

    4. calc_map.m     -> This script calculates the mean average precision for each of the 98 tags.

To run the code:
    Step 1: Run LoadData.m
    Step 2: Run startLearning.m (sets paths for CRBM)
    Step 3: Run demo/BinaryCRBM.m
    Step 4: Run result.m (to get precison and recall for each tag)
    Step 5: Run calc_map.m (for map values)
